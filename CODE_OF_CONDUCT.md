## A Personal Note from the Creator

As the creator of ArtyLLaMA, I want to share why these community guidelines are not just words on a page, but a deeply personal commitment to fostering a truly inclusive environment in AI development.

In my past experiences contributing to open source AI projects, including OpenWebUI, I witnessed and personally experienced harassment and discrimination from other developers. As someone on the autism spectrum, I faced rejection and exclusion based on my neurodiversity and gender identity. These experiences were not only personally hurtful but also highlighted a serious issue in the open source AI community: the very people working to create "intelligent" systems were perpetuating harmful biases and exclusionary practices.

This is why ArtyLLaMA is built on a foundation of radical inclusivity. We recognize that AI, at its core, is about replicating and enhancing human intelligence in all its diverse forms. To create AI that truly benefits everyone, we need everyone's voices, experiences, and perspectives involved in its development.

**TO DO: Writing an blog article on kroonen.ca/blog about my experiences at OpenWebUI and how it inspired ArtyLLaMA.**

## Our Vision

ArtyLLaMA is built on the principle that AI, when developed responsibly, can be a powerful tool for inclusivity and universal benefit. Our project recognizes that the non-judgmental nature of well-aligned AI models presents a unique opportunity to create a truly inclusive environment that celebrates diversity in all its forms.

We believe that diversity is not just welcome, but necessary for the development of AI that serves everyone. Just as AI doesn't discriminate when properly designed, our community must reflect and champion this inclusive approach. Our goal is to harness the collective power of diverse perspectives to create AI tools that benefit all of humanity.

## Our Pledge

In pursuit of our vision, we pledge to:

1. Foster an environment where every voice is heard and valued, regardless of background, identity, or experience level.
2. Actively seek out and encourage contributions from underrepresented groups in tech and AI.
3. Ensure our AI models and tools are developed with diverse inputs to avoid bias and promote inclusivity.
4. Continuously educate ourselves and our community on the importance of diversity in AI development.
5. Provide a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Expected Behavior

- Approach interactions with empathy and respect for diverse experiences and viewpoints.
- Use inclusive language and be mindful of the impact of your words and actions.
- Actively listen to and consider feedback, especially from those with different perspectives.
- Celebrate the contributions of all community members, recognizing that diversity drives innovation.
- Be open to learning about and understanding experiences different from your own.

## Unacceptable Behavior

We do not tolerate discrimination, harassment, or exclusion of any kind. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Discrimination based on neurodiversity, mental health status, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, or age.
- Use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission.
- Any conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Enforcement and Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainers at [contact@artyllama.com](contact@artyllama.com). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. The project team is committed to maintaining confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with these Community Guidelines, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
